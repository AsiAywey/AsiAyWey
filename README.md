This project has login and registration to create a session. It saves the role and id to use later.

The dashboard changes by role. For candidates it shows offers. For companies it shows data, lists, and quick numbers.

The offers page is for viewing jobs and, if you are a company, creating or deleting. It takes data from the server and shows it.

The candidate profile loads their info and lets them change photo and status. What you save there shows in other parts.

The company profile shows its info and lists of candidates, matches, and reservations. From there you do basic actions that affect those lists.

There is a file for server calls and another for cache. That connects all screens with the same data.

The HTML and styles only show the view. The JS adds the logic and connects everything.
